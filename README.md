<h2> A world generation mod adding in <b>five</b>* new underground biomes: <br>the Frozen Caves, the Mushroom Caves, the Molten Caves, and the <b>Amethyst Caves</b> </center></h2>

<br><br>
Profundis is a world generation mod which adds **four** new vanilla-styled underground biomes to the game: the Frozen Caves, the Mushroom Caves, the Molten Caves, and the Amethyst Caves. These three new biomes to wonders to making the underground feel even more diverse.

<i>Profundis is a server-sided mod, meaning it can be installed on a server and clients can join without needing to install a mod, much like a plugin! It can also be installed on a client for Singleplayer!</i>

The Frozen Caves typically generates below cold regions of the world, and has icicles hanging from the ceiling with small ice and snow patches on the ground. Aquifers generating here have a layer of ice on the top, just like frozen lakes and rivers on the surface. Redstone is also extrememly abundant here.

The Mushroom Caves can generate beneath more humid biomes. They have mycelium patches on the ground, with a plethora of small red and brown mushrooms generating everywhere. Huge mushrooms also spawn, although they spawn more often in large caves than small caves. Shelf Fungi can also line the walls, occasionally glowing with Shroomlights, in addition to the biome's higher rate of Glow Lichen.

The Molten Caves can generate in almost any environment. They have lava deltas meandering throughout the stony slopes of the caves, with an abundance of lava springs as well. Basalt columns similar to those in the Basalt Deltas also spawn, although not as frequent as in the Nether. Small patches of Smooth Basalt can occasionally generate on cave surfaces in the Deepslate layer as well. Finally, Iron is more abundant here.

The Amethyst Caves generate underneath hillier areas. They are filled with beautiful Amethyst Veins, with a few Suspended Amethyst Veins dispersed throughout the centers of caves. The crystals leave a gentle glow, alluring miners with their serenity.

The Black Caves generate underneath hillier areas, on the opposite side of valleys as Amethyst Caves. They have walls of Tuff, Deepslate, and Blackstone, hence the name. They also lack Glow Lichen, making it difficult to see in large caverns.

All of the cave biomes' generation can be disabled individually in the config by simply changing a value.
